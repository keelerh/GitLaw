                    <p>
                    W I T N E S E T H:
                    
                    WHEREAS, a marriage is contemplated by W and A; and

                    ARTICLE III
                    
                    SEPARATE PROPERTY
                    
                    A. The following shall constitute the Parties' Separate Property:

                    6. The appreciation in value, income and profits derived from Separate Property, whether by way of sale, exchange, investment, reinvestment or otherwise shall be and remain Separate Property regardless of the “active" or “passive" nature of said Separate Property and regardless or any direct or indirect contribution or effort of the other Party to the maintenance or appreciation of said Separate Property. Joint use of Separate Property or use of Marital Property to maintain Separate Property shall not give rise to joint ownership of such Separate Property or convert it to Marital Property unless such property is placed in joint names or the Parties agree in a writing executed with the same formality as this Agreement. Separate Property used to acquire jointly-owned property will be returned and credited to the Party or Parties that contributed to the purchase of the jointly-owned property, upon a sale of said property or upon the occurrence of a Termination Event as defined below.

                    6.2 The Parties acknowledge and agree that A owns fifty-one (51%) percent of his business which is known as ________________ LLC (“________________"). ________________ is located at________________. A's ownership interest in ________________ is his separate property and W acknowledges it as such separate property. In the event that A acquires additional stock in ________________ during the course of the marriage and prior to a Termination Event by purchase, gift or inheritance or if A purchases said stock with funds belonging to ________________, his interest in ________________ or personal funds he acquired before or during the marriage, A's increased ownership of ________________ shall be and remain A's separate property.
                    7. Any and all retirement accounts, including but not limited to, pensions, 401(k) and IRA accounts, only to the extent of the value in such accounts obtained before the marriage (the “Pre-Marriage Value") and the subsequent appreciation in value, if any, on such Pre-Marriage Value due to passive market forces.
                    8. If the Parties co-mingle any of their Separate Property such Separate Property shall not become Marital Property unless the Parties agree in writing that it become Marital Property or they place the co-mingled property in joint names or in a joint account.
                    9. The Parties agree that under no circumstances shall their Separate Property be considered Marital Property or community property or quasi-community property or otherwise be subject to any claim or right of the other in the event of a Termination Event herein, but shall remain the Parties' Separate Property, notwithstanding any contrary provision of the law of any jurisdiction. Each of them shall own, hold and freely dispose of their Separate Property, wherever it may be situated and whether it is now owned by him or her or may hereafter be acquired by him or her, free from all rights of the other therein under the laws of any jurisdiction. Each of them hereby waives, renounces and releases any and all rights which he or she may have under the laws of any jurisdiction in and to the other's Separate Property in the event of a Termination Event, including, without limitation, rights to Marital Property, equitable distribution, a distributive share, community property, quasi-community property, or any other rights, whether they be vested, contingent or inchoate.
